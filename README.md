As a group we started our project ideas with the google docx planning out what the best api project for our group to accomplish. Ideas ranging from pokemon app, nfl sports fantasy,and a gaming api. We settled on a Covid19 Tracker api intended for any business that needs an app to keep track of how covid is effecting their employees. Once we settled on our project, finished our planning document, dbdiagram, and Trello board. Nick's table is called Employees, Denzel's table Healthstatus, and Marcus's table Department. From there we all got to work on our individual parts.
